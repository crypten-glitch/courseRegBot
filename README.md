# courseRegBot
This is a course registration bot developed to pick and drop courses without incessant user input for hours. This bot uses selenium web driver and operates chrome in a headless mode. It primarily works by using X Path or XML Path Language, and using that, traverses the nodes of a given website, to click on the desired course.
